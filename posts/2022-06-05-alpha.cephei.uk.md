The first host on the new home network will act as a firewall/gateway router and
provide basic network services.

## Hardware

This host needs to have at least 2 network interfaces so that it can act as a
gateway router. CPU, RAM and storage requirements are fairly limited. So this is
the perfect job for an old small-form-factor, passively cooled system which I
have.

I built this system in 2014 to act as a gateway router so it's good to see it
fulfilling that purpose again. The system is built around a
[Jetway NC9KDL](https://www.jetwaycomputer.com/NC9K.html)
motherboard (which has an integrated
[Intel Atom D2550 CPU](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/65470/intel-atom-processor-d2550-1m-cache-1-86-ghz.html)
) with 2GB DDR3 RAM. A few years later I purchased the
[Mini-ITX M5XP case](https://www.mini-itx.com/~M5XP)
which now houses the system and added a
[Corsair 128GB SATA3 SSD](https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/Categories/Products/Storage/SATA-SSDs/Force-Series%E2%84%A2-GS-128GB-SATA-3-6Gb-s-Solid-State-Hard-Drive/p/CSSD-F128GBGS-BK).

## OS Installation

The operating system for this host will be
[OpenSUSE MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org/). This distribution is based on
[OpenSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) so it is
updated on a rolling basis with the latest stable kernel, libraries and
applications. By using MicroOS we also get a read-only root filesystem and
transaction updates with rollback support. We'll be installing very few
additional packages into the host OS, only those needed for functionality such
as routing and firewall configuration which cannot easily be encapsulated within
containers. All other services, including DNS & DHCP for our network, will be
implemented as containers using [Podman](https://podman.io/).

The OS was installed to the 128GB SSD with the following selections made during
installation:

* Partitioning was modified to make space for a 2 GiB swap partition, slightly
  reducing the space available for the `/var` partition. I'm not sure why no
  swap partition was included by default. I always like to have at least a small
  amount of swap available on Linux systems.

* The timezone was set to Europe/London so that I can schedule tasks in my local
  time.

* The hostname was set to `alpha` and the option to use a DHCP provided hostname
  was disabled.

* SELinux security was disabled due to limitations of the default policies. I've
  filed issues in bugzilla for the two problems I found with SELinux enabled
  during testing, hopefully I'll be able to enable SELinux again once these are
  resolved.

  * [SELinux permission issue when provisioning SSH keys](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1200181)

  * [systemd-resolved cannot bind port 53](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1200182)

* The import of existing SSH host keys was disabled.

### Post-installation tasks

#### Update packages

As the MicroOS snapshot I used for installation was a couple of days old, there
were already a few package updates available. To update packages or install
additional packages in MicroOS we need to use the `transactional-update` tool to
create a new rootfs snapshot and then reboot the host so that the new snapshot
becomes activated.

```
transactional-update
reboot
```

#### Add ssh authorized keys

To allow root login over SSH using SSH keys, I imported my SSH public keys from
GitHub:

```
mkdir .ssh
curl https://github.com/pbrkr.keys > .ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### Set Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

The hostname which we set during installation was just `alpha`, without a domain
name component. This is the preferred option as `/etc/hostname` is expected not
to contain an FQDN. However, we do want to set the hosts FQDN to
`alpha.cephei.uk`. This can be done by editing `/etc/hosts` and modifying the
first entry for `127.0.0.1` to read as follows:

```
127.0.0.1       alpha.cephei.uk alpha localhost
```

#### neofetch

Finally, a few additional software packages were installed and the host was
rebooted again to make them available:

```
transactional-update pkg install neofetch htop tmux
reboot
```

After rebooting and performing some additional setup (which I'll cover in the
next netlog post), I used `neofetch` to grab a summary of the system
information:
